## Description

Nest (NestJS) is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications. It uses progressive JavaScript, is built with and fully supports TypeScript (yet still enables developers to code in pure JavaScript) and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```
- The above "npm install" command downloads dependencies defined in a package. json file and generates a node_modules folder with the installed modules
- package.json file describes the start script
- The npm start runs the command specified in the package's "start" property of its "scripts" object.
- .ts files stands for Typescript files.
- TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. TypeScript is pure object oriented with classes, interfaces and statically typed like C# or       Java.
